You know what? Android studio sucks. And gradle also is a piece of shit!

So i've decided to create a bare minimum andorid application to show you how develop an application without these bloated stuff.

I'm using neovim as my editor.(As a replcement for android studio)

And simple shell scripts (Replacement of gradle).
